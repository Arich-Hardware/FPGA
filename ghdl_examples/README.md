# GHDL / VHDL Examples

This directory contains some random examples of VHDL and how to use
the open-source GHDL simulator.

If you have ```ghdl``` and ```gtkwave``` installed, you can type
"Make" to run a demo simulation and create a waveform file
"test.vcd".  Then you can view it with ```gtkwave test.vcd```.
